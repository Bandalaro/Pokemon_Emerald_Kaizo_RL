Pokémon AI Opponent Using Q-Learning 🎮🤖
This project uses Reinforcement Learning (Q-learning) to create a smart AI opponent that dynamically selects a counter team against the player’s Pokémon. Inspired by Pokémon Emerald Kaizo, the AI analyzes the player’s team and builds a challenging, balanced team using PokéAPI data.

🚀 Features
✅ Q-Learning for Team Selection – The AI learns to pick the best counter team dynamically.
✅ PokéAPI Integration – Fetches Pokémon stats, movesets, and types in real-time.
✅ Fully Evolved, Non-Legendary Pokémon – Ensures fair yet strong opponents.
✅ Optimized Movesets – AI Pokémon learn competitive moves without duplicates.
✅ Adjusts to Player’s Strength – AI team matches or exceeds player level.

🔹 How It Works
1️⃣ Reads Player’s Team from a JSON file.
2️⃣ Fetches Pokémon Data from PokéAPI.
3️⃣ Uses Q-learning to decide team strategy (balanced, offensive, defensive).
4️⃣ Selects Counter Pokémon based on weaknesses & synergy.
5️⃣ Assigns Best Moves based on level cap.
6️⃣ Outputs AI Team JSON – Ready for battle simulation!
