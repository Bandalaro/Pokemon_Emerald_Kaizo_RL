PokéAPI

🔹 Technologies Used:
✔ Python – Core programming language
✔ Requests – API calls to fetch Pokémon & move data
✔ NumPy – Q-learning & numerical operations
✔ Natural Language Processing (NLP) – Move description analysis
✔ JSON – Handling Pokémon team data

🔹 Key Features & Algorithms:
✅ Pokémon Selection (Counter Strategy)

Uses PokéAPI to fetch player’s Pokémon
Picks AI’s Pokémon based on type advantage
Ensures non-legendary, fully evolved Pokémon
✅ Move Selection & NLP Integration

Fetches all available moves for AI’s Pokémon
Uses NLP techniques to classify moves:
Offensive (damage-based)
Status (buff/debuff/healing)
Priority (faster execution)
Scores moves based on Power, Accuracy, PP, Priority
Formula:
python
Copy
Edit
score = (power * 1.2) + (accuracy * 0.8) + (pp * 0.5) + (priority * 2.0)
✅ Reinforcement Learning (Q-Learning)

Implements Q-learning for AI playstyle selection
AI can play Offensive, Defensive, or Balanced based on battle scenario
Updates Q-table to improve future decisions
✅ Battle Strategy Implementation
1️⃣ Load player team from JSON
2️⃣ Pick counter Pokémon using type advantage
3️⃣ Fetch all possible moves
4️⃣ Classify moves using NLP
5️⃣ Score moves based on battle effectiveness
6️⃣ Use Q-learning to decide AI playstyle
7️⃣ Generate optimized AI team

🔹 Future Enhancements:
🔥 Deep Learning for Move Classification (BERT, GPT-like models)
🔥 Dynamic Battle Simulation – Train Q-learning agent on actual battle results
🔥 Genetic Algorithms for Team Optimization

This AI thinks strategically, picks strong counters, and selects high-impact moves! 🎮🔥
